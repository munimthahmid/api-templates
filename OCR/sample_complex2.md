WHAT IS A HACK ATHON ?
A hackathon is an exciting, fast-paced event
where creativity meets innovation! It’s a gathering
of developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and
problem-solvers who collaborate to build
something amazing in a limited timeframe.
It’s not just about coding – it’s about turning ideas
into reality. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or a
curious beginner, hackathons are all about
teamwork, learning, and creating something
you’re proud of. Dive in, and let your imagination
lead the way!

AI & AP I Hack athon
We are thrilled to announce an exclusive AI & API
Hackathon, a dynamic 24-hours onsite event that will
put your creativity and problem-solving skills to the test!
Participants will form diverse teams, blending skills to
tackle AI and API development challenges. The problem
statement will be revealed at the event's start, ensuring
fairness. Mentors and problem setters will provide
guidance throughout the event.
University students nationwide, regardless of experience,
are encouraged to join. Beginners can attend workshops
on essential AI and API concepts to get started.
If you’re passionate about technology and innovation,
this is your chance to collaborate, learn, and create!

The Hackathon team, alongside experienced industry
professionals, will conduct an initial screening process to
shortlist participants for the onsite Hackathon. Selected
participants will be notified and invited to proceed to the
onsite event.
For our Hackathon, this may include
❑ API Development Tasks: Building an API server to
perform a specific task or modifying an existing
backend server.
❑ AI Development Tasks: Fine-tuning a model or building
an AI pipeline using frameworks like LangChain,
LlamaIndex, or similar tools.
This approach ensures participants are well-prepared
and align with the event's technical focus.
Time & Team Formation Strategy
❑ Time Limit: Adjusted according to the problem set.
❑ Team Structure: Teams of 3 members, with a balanced
understanding of both API development and AI
concepts, are recommended.

Participants will utilize public APIs or their own custom-
developed AI models to implement tasks such as
Speech-to-Text, Translation, OCR, or Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Creativity in integrating AI is highly
encouraged, whether by leveraging APIs from popular
platforms or by building and deploying custom AI
models.
Additional tasks may include
❑ Fine-tuning or training a model to improve its
performance.
❑ Developing AI pipelines or AI Agents.
Participants may also need to implement core
functionalities such as Authentication, CRUD operations,
and Data management using relevant APIs/SDKs to
enhance the functionality and scalability of their
applications. Extra points will be awarded for innovative
solutions that meet the problem requirements while
demonstrating efficient and creative AI integration.

Scenario
Imagine a platform where students and teachers can collaboratively
manage and share study materials. A student uploads class notes, and
the system automatically organizes them, generates quizzes, and
facilitates AI-driven discussions. Teachers have a dedicated portal to
review and validate content, while students can interact with their
peers and the notes to enhance learning.
Tasks
➢ Authentication & Role-Based Access Control
o Implement separate authentication systems for students and
teachers.
o Ensure teachers have additional permissions to approve, edit,
or annotate uploaded notes.
➢ Class Note Sharing
o Allow students to upload notes (PDFs or images).
o Use OCR technology (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, Tesseract) to
extract text from these files, enabling searchable and
organized content.
➢ AI-Driven Quiz Generation
o Use AI tools like OpenAI, Gemini or Hugging Face to generate
quizzes based on uploaded class notes.
o Questions should align with the difficulty level of the content
and the user’s role (student or teacher).

➢ Chat with Class Notes
o Develop a chatbot feature where users can query uploaded
notes.
o Use AI language models to provide relevant answers based on
the content.
➢ AI-Based Matchmaking for Study Groups
o Implement an AI algorithm to match students with similar
interests or challenges for collaborative study sessions.
o Use clustering or recommendation techniques to group
students dynamically.
➢ APIs and Custom Models
o Participants can use APIs like OpenAI, Gemini, Groq, Antrhopic
etc. & Frameworks/Libraries like LangChain, or LlamaIndex etc.
for quiz generation, chatbot interaction, or note organization.
o They can also use local model or develop custom models for
matchmaking, note summarization, or content validation.
Bonus Points
❑ Creativity in designing a seamless user experience for both
students and teachers.
❑ Efficient integration of AI and APIs to enhance study collaboration
and resource management.
(The tools and examples mentioned are just suggestions. Participants
are encouraged to explore a wide range of APIs and frameworks to
implement their solutions!)
